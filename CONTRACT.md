# message-store routes

All JSON. Times are unix milliseconds, UTC. Errors are `{"error": "…"}`: 400 for
a bad request (an unknown field included), 404 for a missing id.

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | `{"status":"ok"}` when the database answers |
| `GET /settings` | the declared settings and their values |
| `GET /vocabulary` | platforms, message kinds, activity groupings and intervals |
| `GET /summary` | conversations and messages per platform, with first and last times |
| `GET /messages` | messages in time order. `conversation` (repeatable; a merged id reads the conversation it merged into), `person`, `platform`, `source` and `source_ref` (the one message an importer filed under that ref, such as a Discord message id; `source_ref` alone is a 400), `after`, `before`, `q` (full text), `order=oldest\|newest`, `limit` (≤5000, default 500), `cursor` (the last page's `next`) |
| `GET /messages/{id}/revisions` | every earlier version of a message, oldest first: `import_id`, `revised_at` and the whole `row` as it was before that import changed it |
| `GET /messages/{id}` | one message; a superseded id is a 301 whose relative `Location` is the message that holds it now |
| `GET /superseded-messages` | retired rows, newest first, each with its whole old row as `row`. `superseded_by`, `limit` |
| `GET /accounts` | accounts of ours, the user's own first: `id` (`message_account_000001`), `platform`, `handle` (the user id there), `display_name`, `kind` (`GET /vocabulary` `account_kinds`: `user`, `bot`) |
| `GET /accounts/{id}` | one account |
| `POST /accounts` | `{"platform","handle","display_name","kind"}`: the account with that platform and handle, made if new; an empty display name keeps the stored one |
| `GET /conversations` | most recently active first. `account` (the conversations with a participant of the account's handle on its platform), `person`, `platform`, `q` (title or participant name), `limit` |
| `GET /conversations/{id}` | one conversation, participants and message summary; a merged id is a 301 whose relative `Location` is the conversation it merged into |
| `GET /conversation-merges` | merged conversations, newest first, each with its whole old row and participants as `row`. `merged_into`, `limit` |
| `PATCH /conversations/{id}/participants/{handle}` | `{"person_id":"person_000001"}` names the handle's person; `""` clears it |
| `GET /conversation-days` | `conversation`, `journal_entry`, `person`, `from`, `to` (YYYY-MM-DD), `limit`; `involved=true` keeps only days the user took part in. Each day says its `involvement` (`GET /vocabulary` `day_involvements`): `direct` (not a group), `participated` (the user wrote that day), `addressed` (someone replied to them or mentioned them, Discord `<@id>`), or `none` |
| `GET /conversation-days/{id}` | the day, its conversation and its messages |
| `POST /conversation-days/journal-entries` | `[{"journal_source","journal_source_ref","journal_entry_id"}]`: records which journal entry held each day's transcript; answers `linked` and `unmatched` |
| `GET /activity` | message counts per time bucket. `group_by=person\|conversation\|platform`, `interval=day\|week\|month\|year`, `time_zone` (IANA, required), `person`, `after`, `before`; `involved=true` leaves out a group's messages on local days (in `time_zone`) the user neither wrote in it nor was replied to or mentioned, judged from the messages, so chats with no conversation days count the same way, so a channel the user only belonged to does not fill a timeline |
| `GET /imports`, `GET /imports/{id}` | import runs and what each wrote |
| `POST /imports` | `{"importer","description"}` starts a run |
| `POST /imports/{id}/batches` | `{"conversations","messages","conversation_days","supersessions","conversation_merges"}`, written in one transaction: one bad record writes nothing |
| `POST /imports/{id}/finish` | ends a run |

## Import rules

- A conversation is found by `(source, source_ref)`. An empty title in a batch
  keeps the stored one. Participants are added or updated by handle; a
  participant's `person_id` is written only when the batch gives one, so a
  person set by hand survives an import that knows nobody.
- A message's `embeds` and `buttons` (a bot's cards and the buttons under a
  message) are replaced by an import that sends any and kept by one that sends
  none.
- A participant's `is_self` is set by an import that sends it and never
  cleared by one that does not.
- A message is found by `(source, source_ref)`. The same `source_hash` skips it;
  another hash rewrites it. A sender handle the conversation never listed gets a
  participant row.
- A message's `supersedes` lists `(source, source_ref)` keys of rows that hold
  the same message under another id namespace. Each that exists is copied
  whole to `superseded_messages` (with the import and the message that
  replaced it) and removed from `messages`; its id then redirects. A batch
  counts them as `messages_superseded`. A message sent again under a
  superseded key is skipped and counted as `messages_superseded_skipped`.
- A batch's `supersessions` (`[{"superseded":{source,source_ref},"by":{source,source_ref}}]`,
  applied after its messages) retire a row in favour of a message already
  stored, for an importer that does not own that message. A `by` that is not
  stored is a 400; a `superseded` that is not stored, or already retired, is
  nothing to do.
- A batch's `conversation_merges` (`[{"merged":{source,source_ref},"into":{source,source_ref},"rule"}]`,
  applied after its supersessions and before its days) make two conversations
  one. `rule` is one of `GET /vocabulary`'s `conversation_merge_rules`. The
  merged conversation's messages, days and participants move to the other (a
  handle in both keeps what the survivor knows and learns what it does not),
  its row and participants are copied whole to `conversation_merges`, and it is
  removed; its id then redirects. Its `(source, source_ref)` resolves to the
  survivor on every later import, which adds participants but never changes
  the survivor's title, platform or `is_group`. Either key may name a
  conversation merged earlier. A side the store does not hold is skipped and
  counted (`conversation_merges_skipped`); two days on the same date in both
  conversations is a 400.
- A conversation day is found by `(conversation, day)`; its span is computed from
  `day` and `time_zone`.

## Activity by person

A message counts for a person when that person sent it (`received`), or when
the user sent it in a direct conversation with that person (`sent`). The user's
messages in a group are credited to nobody.
